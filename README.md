# Django-CRUD
In my project, I developed a Python Django CRUD application using HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The application provides users with a user-friendly interface to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a database.

To create an appealing and responsive design, I utilized HTML for structuring web pages, JavaScript for interactive and dynamic functionality, and Bootstrap for styling and layout components. This combination ensured a seamless user experience across different devices.

The application allows users to create new records, retrieve existing data, update information, and delete entries from the database. User input is facilitated through HTML forms and JavaScript event handling, triggering the necessary backend operations in Django.

Furthermore, the project incorporates session management functionality. Users can maintain their session state while interacting with the website, enabling them to log in, perform actions, and have their session information stored and accessible throughout their browsing session.

By leveraging Django's session management features, the application handles user authentication, session creation, and session expiration. This ensures secure storage of user data and preferences throughout their session, eliminating the need for repeated authentication.

Overall, the project combines Python Django CRUD functionality with HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to deliver a visually appealing and user-friendly application. The incorporation of session management enhances security and provides a seamless browsing experience, enabling users to perform CRUD operations and maintain their session information securely.
